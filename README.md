# Prettyplotting

My collection of examples, templates and functions to make better plots for publications and presentations. Very much a work in progress...

## The `figsize` module
This module mainly consists of one function to set an appropriate figure size in matplotlib, so that the image does not have to be scaled in with LaTeX.
Inspired by [this](https://jwalton.info/Embed-Publication-Matplotlib-Latex/) blog post.

## The `colors` module
This module implements colors from a palette inspired by the [RWTH Aachen corporate design](https://www9.rwth-aachen.de/global/show_document.asp?id=aaaaaaaaaadpbhq).

**Disclaimer**: No claim to completeness or correctness of the official RWTH Aachen corporate design is made.

## Installing
`Prettyplotting` can be installed by cloning the repository and then calling `pip install .` from within the directory.
